# IWS-Prometheus-Grafana
 Demo setup for Prometheus and Grafana IWS Dashboard

 **Purpose**:
The purpose of this repository is to provide a sample prometheus.yml file for connection to IBM Workload Scheduler 9.5 FP 4 an 10.1. The example is for users who attended the IBM AIOps IwS  Track on May 04 2023. It is to allow IWS admins to have a go themselves before looking at how to do it internally and get benefits from Observaility.

 **Assumptions**:
The following assumptions have been made when these instructions were put together:
1. Docker is installed already within the readers environment, either on the person's desktop/laptop or a server
2. The reader has access to the internet, without a restriction to connect to the test MDM & DWC
3. The reader is an experienced IWS administrator who will understand the ouput shown on the Grafana Dashboard

If you find any assumptions I've missed then please let me know in the issues section.

 **Steps**:

 **Conclusions**:
